# Jira Issue to Markdown Action

This action allows you to retrieve Jira `DONE` subtasks from an issue and generate a markdown file with release notes, including detailed issue and subtask information. The branch name must match the pattern used in Jira. Refer to [Inputs](#inputs) for more information.

## Features

- Retrieve Jira issues and `DONE` subtasks.
- Format Jira issue details into markdown.
- Output a formatted release description suitable for GitHub releases.
- Integrate directly with GitHub pull requests and push events.

## Usage

To use this action, you need to pass the `branch_name` (matching your Jira issue pattern) and `jira_data` (which contains your Jira authentication and project information).

Hereâ€™s how you can use this action in your GitHub workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  jira-issue-to-markdown:
    name: Run Jira Tasks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Jira Tasks
        id: jira_tasks
        uses: iamigui/jira-issue-to-markdown@v1
        with:
          branch_name: "branchname"
          jira_data: ${{ secrets.JIRA_DATA }}
```

## Inputs

- **branch_name** (required): The branch name that corresponds to the Jira issue key (e.g., PROJECTKEY-10). This is used to fetch the corresponding Jira issue and its subtasks.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Ensure your branch_name matches the pattern used for Jira issues (e.g., PROJECTKEY-123).

- **jira_data** (required): A JSON object from a secret containing the following keys for authentication and project information:

```JSON
{
  "api_token": "your-api-token",
  "email": "email@example.com",
  "domain": "youratlassiandomain",
  "project_key": "PROJECTKEY"
}
```

These values will be passed to the action securely as GitHub secrets. See [Secret Inputs](#secret-inputs) for more details.

## Outputs

- **release_content**: The formatted release notes in markdown, which includes the parent issue and its associated subtasks.

Example output:

```markdown
## Parent Issue

[SCRUM-10](https://youratlassiandomain.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1?selectedIssue=PROJECTKEY-10)

## Main Updates

- [SCRUM-14](https://youratlassiandomain.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1?selectedIssue=PROJECTKEY-14): Create subtasks to be passed into the release file
- [SCRUM-18](https://youratlassiandomain.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1?selectedIssue=PROJECTKEY-18): Handle response data
- [SCRUM-19](https://youratlassiandomain.atlassiandomain.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1?selectedIssue=PROJECTKEY-19): Only add DONE subtask
```

## Example

### Example 1: Push and Pull Request Workflow

This example shows how you can integrate this action into a workflow that triggers on both push and pull request events.

```YAML
name: Tag and Release in Github

on:
  push:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

permissions:
  contents: write  # Grant permission to write to the repository

jobs:
  jira-issue-to-markdown:
    name: Run Jira Tasks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"

      - name: Get tag
        shell: bash
        id: get_tag
        run: |
          git fetch --all

          if [ -z "${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}" ]; then
            echo "branch=${{ github.ref }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            git checkout ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
            echo "branch=${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi
          echo "version=v$(npm pkg get version | tr -d '\"')" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Jira Tasks
        id: jira_tasks
        uses: iamigui/jira-issue-to-markdown@v1
        with:
          branch_name: ${{ steps.get_tag.outputs.branch }}
          jira_data: ${{ secrets.JIRA_DATA }}

      - name: Get Outputs
        shell: bash
        run: |
          echo "Release content from the previous step: ${{ steps.jira_tasks.outputs.release_content }}"

```

### Example 2: Integrate in Pull Request Release

This example shows how to use this action specifically in a pull request to automatically generate and attach release notes based on Jira issues and subtasks.

```YAML
name: Tag and Release in Github

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

permissions:
  contents: write  # Grant permission to write to the repository

jobs:
  tag-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Git
        shell: bash
        run: |
          git config user.name "gh-actions-releaser"
          git config user.email "ghactionsreleaser@gmail.com"

      - name: Get tag
        shell: bash
        id: get_tag
        run: |
          git fetch --all

          if [ -z "${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}" ]; then
            echo "branch=${{ github.ref }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            git checkout ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
            echo "branch=${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi
          echo "version=v$(npm pkg get version | tr -d '\"')" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Tag the Commit
        if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.merged == true }}
        shell: bash
        run: |
          next_version=${{ steps.get_tag.outputs.version }}
          git tag $next_version
          git push origin $next_version
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Launch Jira Tasks
        id: jira_tasks
        uses: iamigui/jira-issue-to-markdown@v1
        if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.merged == true }}
        with:
          branch_name: ${{ steps.get_tag.outputs.branch }}
          jira_data: ${{ secrets.JIRA_DATA }}

      - name: Release
        id: release
        shell: bash
        if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.merged == true }}
        run: |
          TAG_NAME=${{ steps.get_tag.outputs.version }}
          PR_DESCRIPTION="${{ steps.jira_tasks.outputs.release_content }}"
          echo "Creating release for tag: $TAG_NAME"
          echo "Description: $PR_DESCRIPTION"

          # Create the release with the PR description
          gh release create $TAG_NAME --title "$TAG_NAME" --notes "$PR_DESCRIPTION"
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

```

## Secret Inputs

To securely pass Jira credentials, you need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

Example of **JIRA_DATA** secret:

```JSON
{
  "api_token": "your-api-token",
  "email": "email@example.com",
  "domain": "youratlassiandomain",
  "project_key": "PROJECTKEY"
}
```

Make sure to add these secrets in your GitHub repository's Secrets section (**Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**).
